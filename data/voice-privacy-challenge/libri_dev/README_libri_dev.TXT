libri_dev is a development set for the VoicePrivacy Challenge.
It is a subset of the LibriSpeech ASR corpus: http://www.openslr.org/12/
This subset corresponds to the dev-clean subset of the original LibriSpeech corpus.

Differences from the original dev-clean subset:
1. Audio files are in wav format;
2. Trials/Enrollment lists for ASV evaluation are provided.
