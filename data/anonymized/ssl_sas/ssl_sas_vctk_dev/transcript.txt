p234_006_mic2_gen When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. 
p234_007_mic2_gen The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. 
p234_008_mic2_gen These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.

p234_021_mic2_gen The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. 
p234_022_mic2_gen The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. 
p234_023_mic2_gen If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. 
p234_024_mic2_gen This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.

p238_027_mic2_gen We must convince the citizens.

p245_026_mic2_gen But it failed.
p245_027_mic2_gen It's nice to hear.
p245_028_mic2_gen We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
